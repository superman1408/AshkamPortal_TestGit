              Engineering Consulting Firm operating from tier- II city of India.
              We started off our journey rather slowly. However, with the backup
              of years of experience, knowledge, and the commitment and vision
              needed to enter a competitive environment we have been able to
              make our name and place in the industry. Ashkam with the motto of
              Thriving on Excellence is on the right track to becoming a dynamic
              multi-disciplinary engineering consulting company in Marine &
